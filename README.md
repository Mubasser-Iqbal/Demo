# Igniz Overview

#### **What is Igniz?**

Igniz is a high-performance decentralized exchange platform built on Web3 infrastructure with the vision of delivering a fully decentralized, trust-less trading ecosystem that rivals centralized exchanges in speed, cost efficiency, and user experience. The platform seamlessly integrates multiple Layer 1 and Layer 2 blockchain protocols with multi-chain deposit support, enabling users to deposit and trade assets from any supported blockchain network directly within a unified interface while maintaining complete ownership and control of their assets.

#### **Technical Overview**

Igniz is architected as a multi-layer decentralized trading platform optimized from the ground up to address the fundamental challenges of blockchain scalability, transaction costs, and user experience.

Igniz scales horizontally across multiple blockchain networks, supporting both Layer 1 solutions (Ethereum, BSC, Solana, Avalanche, Fantom, Cardano, Cosmos) and Layer 2 scaling solutions (ZK rollups, sidechains). The platform features multi-chain deposit infrastructure, allowing users to deposit and trade assets from any supported blockchain network directly within the interface. The platform leverages Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocols and cross-chain bridges to enable seamless asset migration across chains. Future development includes deployment of custom Cosmos SDK-based blockchains and ZK-STARKs rollups to further enhance throughput and scalability.

The platform features decentralized liquidity pools and complete privacy with no KYC requirements. Users need only connect a Web3-compatible wallet to begin trading immediately with no registration, volume caps, or withdrawal limits.
