# Wallet Backup

#### **Accessing Your Wallet Credentials**

When you sign up using Google, Email, or X (twitter) authentication, Igniz automatically generates a blockchain wallet associated with your account. In certain situations, you may need to export your private key to access this wallet through external wallet applications.

#### **When You Need Wallet Export**

You may need to export your wallet credentials if you:

* Accidentally transferred unsupported assets to your wallet address
* Want to access your wallet through MetaMask, Wallet Connect, or other wallet extensions
* Need to recover assets sent to the wrong network
* Prefer to manage your wallet independently of the Igniz platform

#### **Exporting Your Private Key**

1. Ensure you are logged in with your Google, Email, or X (twitter) account on the Igniz platform.
2. Navigate to the Settings menu from the navigation bar.
3. Select "Export Wallet" from the available options.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to reveal and copy your private key.
5. **Security Warning:**&#x59;our private key provides complete access to your wallet and all associated funds. Never share this key with anyone, and store it securely offline.

#### **Importing to External Wallets**

After exporting your private key, you can import it into any EVM-compatible wallet:

1. Open your wallet extension (MetaMask, Wallet Connect, etc.).
2. Select "Import Account" or "Import Wallet" from the wallet menu.
3. Choose "Private Key" as the import method.
4. Paste your exported private key and confirm.
5. Your Igniz wallet will now be accessible through the external wallet application.

#### **Important Security Considerations**

* Anyone with access to your private key has full control over your assets.
* Store your private key in a secure, offline location.
* Never enter your private key on untrusted websites or applications.
* Consider using a hardware wallet for enhanced security if managing significant assets.
