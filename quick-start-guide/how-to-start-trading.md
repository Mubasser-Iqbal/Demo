# How to Start Trading

#### **Prerequisites for Trading**

Igniz operates as a fully decentralized platform with no registration or identity verification requirements. Trading access requires only a Web3-compatible wallet connection.

**Required Components:**

**EVM-Compatible Wallet**

* Compatible wallets include MetaMask, WalletConnect and OKX Wallet.
* New users can create a wallet at [https://metamask.io/](https://metamask.io/).
* After installing your preferred wallet extension, initialize a new account.
* **Critical Security Note:**&#x59;our recovery phrase grants complete access to your assets. Never share your private key or seed phrase with anyone. Store your recovery phrase in a secure physical location.

**Trading Collateral**

* Any supported token across integrated blockchain networks (Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Arbitrum, and additional L1/L2 chains).
* Stablecoins (USDC recommended) serve as optimal trading collateral.

#### **Platform Access**

Igniz is accessible through two interfaces:
