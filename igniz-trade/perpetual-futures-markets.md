# Perpetual Futures Markets

#### **Available Trading Instruments**

Igniz provides access to perpetual futures contracts across a diverse range of digital assets, encompassing major cryptocurrencies, emerging tokens, and alternative assets. The platform continuously expands its market offerings based on trader demand and governance proposals from the Igniz community.

Asset listing follows a structured evaluation process that considers trading volume, liquidity depth, and community interest. The platform roadmap includes transition to a fully permissionless listing mechanism where token projects can autonomously deploy perpetual markets through governance approval.

#### **Leverage Parameters**

Perpetual contracts on Igniz support variable leverage ratios tailored to each asset's volatility profile and market maturity. Leverage availability ranges from conservative 3x multipliers for highly volatile assets to aggressive 50x multipliers for established, liquid markets.

**Margin Requirements:**

The maintenance margin threshold is calculated as half the initial margin requirement at maximum leverage. This relationship ensures balanced risk management while providing traders with capital efficiency.

**Example Calculation:**

* For an asset with 25x maximum leverage, the initial margin requirement is 4% (1/25)
* The corresponding maintenance margin is 2% (half of 4%)
* Positions are subject to liquidation when account margin falls below the maintenance threshold

This tiered margin structure enables efficient capital utilization while protecting the platform's overall solvency and minimizing systemic risk from excessive leverage exposure.
