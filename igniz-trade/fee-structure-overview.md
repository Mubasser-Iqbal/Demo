# Fee Structure Overview

Igniz operates on a competitive fee structure designed to support active traders while maintaining platform sustainability. Trading fees are calculated and assessed at the end of each UTC day. All sub-accounts under a master account contribute toward the same fee tier and share identical fee rates.

Maker rebates are credited directly to your trading wallet in real-time upon trade execution. Partnership rewards can be claimed through the dedicated Partnership page on the platform.

### Key Fee Advantages <a href="#key-fee-advantages" id="key-fee-advantages"></a>

**Zero-Cost Order Placement**: Igniz allows traders to create, modify, and cancel orders without incurring any gas fees or network charges. You only pay fees when trades are executed.

**Dual Market Fee Schedules**: Separate fee structures exist for perpetual futures and spot markets to ensure competitive pricing across both trading environments.

### Volume Calculation <a href="#volume-calculation" id="volume-calculation"></a>

Spot trading volume contributes double weight toward fee tier advancement, incentivizing liquidity provision across both markets.

### Market-Specific Fee Conditions <a href="#market-specific-fee-conditions" id="market-specific-fee-conditions"></a>

* **Unified Fee Tier**: A single fee tier applies across all tradable assets, including standard perpetuals, spot markets, and provisional futures contracts
* **Provisional Futures**: These contracts incur 2× the standard taker fees while maintaining equivalent maker rebates
* **Stablecoin Pairs**: Spot trading pairs between two stablecoin assets benefit from 80% reduced taker fees, proportional maker rebates, and reduced volume contribution toward tier progression

### Enhanced Maker Rebates <a href="#enhanced-maker-rebates" id="enhanced-maker-rebates"></a>

Traders who consistently provide liquidity to the order book may qualify for enhanced maker rebates based on their maker-to-total volume ratio:

| Rebate Tier | 14-Day Maker Volume Ratio | Enhanced Maker Fee |
| ----------- | ------------------------- | ------------------ |
| 1           | > 0.5%                    | -0.001%            |
| 2           | > 1.5%                    | -0.002%            |
| 3           | > 3.0%                    | -0.003%            |

Enhanced maker rebates are applied on top of standard maker fees when qualified, resulting in net rebates paid to liquidity providers.

### Fee Distribution <a href="#fee-distribution" id="fee-distribution"></a>

Igniz operates on a community-first fee distribution model. Trading fees are allocated to support platform development, liquidity providers, and the decentralized community fund. Unlike traditional platforms where fees primarily benefit internal teams or insiders, Igniz directs fee revenue toward:

* **Liquidity Pool Contributors**: Users providing liquidity to trading pairs earn proportional fee shares
* **Community Development Fund**: Supporting ongoing platform improvements, security audits, and ecosystem growth
* **Token Deployers**: For spot markets, token deployers may receive up to 50% of trading fees generated by their deployed asset pairs

The community development fund operates through transparent on-chain mechanisms, with all allocations subject to governance protocols and validator consensus for enhanced security and accountability.

### Important Notes <a href="#important-notes" id="important-notes"></a>

* **Real-Time Fee Assessment**: Fees are calculated and deducted at the moment of trade execution
* **No Deposit/Withdrawal Fees**: Igniz does not charge fees for deposits or withdrawals, though network gas fees apply for on-chain transactions
* **No Order Management Fees**: Fee-free order creation, modification, and cancellation
* **Fee Tier Updates**: Your fee tier is recalculated daily based on rolling 14-day volume, allowing for automatic tier progression or regression
